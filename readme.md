### UI Automation framework based on Specflow and Selenium, written in C#

Includes a few tests for my BrowserTrack website for demonstration purposes.

Supports page objects and multilingual websites.

Also includes an customised BDD html report based on [ExtentReports](https://github.com/anshooarora/extentreports-csharp) and and [SpecResults](https://github.com/timschlechter/SpecResults) libraries.
